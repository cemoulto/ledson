# The Castle

“This castle is a must-see.”  -Bella English, The Boston Globe

The Majesty of The Castle
Take Just One Look and Fall in Love

Merging bucolic charm and gothic drama, The Castle is Ledson’s jewel, spanning 16,000 square feet within the acres of rolling vineyards and breathtaking California countryside.  
It’s a stunning setting for wine tasting weekends, romantic getaways or corporate retreats.

When beginning construction in 1989, the Ledson family originally planned to use The Castle as a residence. The public had other plans, as its striking turrets, balconies and fountains caught the interest of passers-by, some even climbing the fences to get a better look. It became clear to Ledson that The Castle was destined to be an international landmark and should be shared. Surrounded by 17 acres of Merlot, the Ledson’s decided to turn the home into a winery and tasting room. In 1999, following the release of their first wine, the 1994 Ledson Estate Merlot, the doors opened to the public. Instantly, The Castle became an internationally respected architectural showpiece.

Designed entirely by winemaker Steve Ledson, the castle boasts sweeping staircases, marble fireplaces, cathedral-style windows, coffered ceilings, several tasting bars, luxuriously appointed bridal suites and over five miles of ornate wood inlays and mosaics, which were hand cut and installed by Steve's son, Mike.
