    <h1>Wines</h1><p>&quot;As someone whose great-grandfather first grew grapes and made wine here in 1862, I am deeply committed to our family&#39;s tradition of crafting world class wines from California&#39;s finest vineyard sites&quot; - Steve Ledson, Fifth Generation Sonoma Wine Grower  The Ledson family specializes in small lots of hand-crafted wines reflecting California&#39;s uniquely diverse terroir. Expressed across a broad range of varietals including Merlot, Pinot Noir, Sangiovese, Syrah, Petite Sirah, Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Malbec, Barbera, Mourvedre, Primitivo, Grenache, Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Rosé and Madera Port, Ledson Wines champion sense-of-place flavors and wine making artistry.  In the vineyard we carefully match the rootstock and clone to the most appropriate growing conditions and farm each site one vine at a time. In the cellar we meticulously control fermentations for utmost flavor intensity, mouth feel and balance. We handle the wines as little as possible to allow the natural melding of varietal and vineyard flavors. Our wines age in French oak barrels from the finest coopers and forests as well as a variety of toast levels to add complexity and nuance.  Our wines are sold exclusively through the Ledson Winery in Kenwood and at our Ledson Hotel in Sonoma.</p>
