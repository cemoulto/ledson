    <h1>Philosophy</h1><p>We believe that a good bottle of wine should be shared with good friends.  Ledson’s long tradition of grape growing is deeply rooted in the Sonoma soil, and nothing makes us happier than being able to share this legacy with you. We cultivate a deep connection to the land, to the intimate process of winemaking and to the community, where our family has done business since the 1800s. Plan a trip to the winery and you’ll be welcomed to our remarkable vineyard and tasting room with open arms. One of our winemakers, personally trained wine specialists or even Steve Ledson himself will greet you like family.</p>
