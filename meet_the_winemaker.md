# Meet the Winemaker
Like wine, Steve Ledson believes that life is an experience to be shared. A fifth generation farmer, Steve’s many passions are borne of a desire to create the very best. Whether it’s  grape growing and winemaking, raising cattle, building incredible works of architecture or cultivating an intimate community, the fruits of Steve’s labor always show the telltale signs of a devoted visionary. Don’t be surprised if you become fast friends or get entranced in a long conversation over his bottle-du-jour at The Castle. In Steve’s world, there’s not a day that goes by that isn’t packed full of opportunity to create, learn and make new friends.
