<p>Just an hour drive from San Francisco, The Castle, a massive French Normandy winery, sits amidst one of the finest vineyards in the world. The architect, winemaker Steve Ledson himself, admittedly got a little carried away during construction of what was once planned to be his family home. Completed in 1999, the showpiece chateau now functions as an incomparable backdrop for an afternoon among the vines, welcoming wine lovers to Ledson from the moment they spot it on the road. Boasting beautifully appointed hand-crafted tasting bars, impeccable grounds with picnic areas shadowed by 100-year-old majestic oak trees, a fully stocked gourmet market and a tasteful clothing and gift boutique, the Ledson Winery is an ideal venue for an unforgettable afternoon picnic, tasting or weekend getaway.  
Specializing in small varietal lots that reflect the genuine diversity of hyper-select vineyards and appellations, Ledson wines are sold exclusively on The Castle grounds, the winery in Kenwood, in the online store and at the Ledson Hotel in Sonoma. With over 70 wines to choose from, vinter Steve Ledson likes to say ‘We make a wine for everybody’s palate and price.’</p>
